# Full Stack Trivia API Backend - Gordon Deng


## Description

This is my second project for the Udacity Nanodegree.  This project was created with start code from the [Udacity Github Project 2 repository](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/tree/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter).  This project creates a trivia application on the localhost port 3000 with a React frontend and a python/flask_sqlalchemy/postresql database backend on localhost port 5000.

Please refer to the README.md files within the frontend and backend folders for more information.
